If you plan to maintain a page out of the index, you can use this in your HTML head and in the hyperlink. It prevents the page from indexing in the search and recommends that the search engine to not follow the link.</p>\n<p><strong>2) Not using canonicalization</strong><br />\nCanonicalization prevents indexing of duplicate content or page in search, which can impact your domain authority. You can use this rel=canonical tag in the HTML head. It recommends search engines that instead of the current page, the linked URL should be treated as “source/canon” by the search engines.</p>\n<p><strong>3) Poor use of outbound links</strong><br />\nAccording to Google’s algorithm, outbound links are diluting the authority that gets passed back to your own site. It doesn’t mean that you shouldn’t give link to others but you can limit the usage. For better page ranking you should always use new and rich content in your site.</p>\n<p><strong>4) Using frames</strong><br />\nGoogle changes its algorithm frequently so some of the methodology get outdated quickly. iFrames can cause problems for search engines because they don’t correspond to the conceptual model of the web. iframes embed multiple urls in a single page and it can  affect the ranking and dilute the authority.</p>\n<p><strong>5) Poor internal link structure</strong><br />\nYou should build your site with a logical link structure. In general, minimum one static text link should present to reach every page. You can use contextual links within the body content to get more link counts for a page in addition to the links in the navigation and they certainly add semantic value to the linked page.</p>\n<p><strong>6) Poor URL architecture</strong><br />\nLack of solid URL architecture is one of the most frequent issues happening in SEO. Good url architecture means easily readable for humans as well as for search engines.</p>\n<p><strong>7) Using image alt attributes incorrectly</strong><br />\nImage attribute or “alt tag” is one of the crucial parameter in modern level SEO. The alt tag provides a text alternative for an image if that image cannot be displayed. Also it is well suited for visually impaired users to understand the image. We can target keywords to represent the image in search result.</p>\n<p><strong>8) Missing or duplicate meta descriptions</strong><br />\nMeta Description is nothing but the content for search engines to refer and show in their search result snippet. Don’t miss the chance to focus target keywords using meta description. It gives users a hint to the content provided in a page.</p>\n<p><strong>9) No XML sitemap (or Outdated)</strong><br />\nXML sitemaps are still valuable, and every website should need one. If you add your XML sitemap through Google Search Console, you don’t need to worry about the availability in search engines. Since websites changes frequently you should update your sitemap accordingly. It allows crawlers to understand the hierarchy of your site.</p>\n<p><strong>10) Improper use of heading tags</strong><br />\nSome people mistakenly understand the usage of heading tags. You can’t use H1 tags in sub headings. And use other heading tags such as H2, H3 properly. Structuring heading tags in a proper way helps searching engines to understand the hierarchy of the content.</p>\n<p>Hope you liked this infographic.
